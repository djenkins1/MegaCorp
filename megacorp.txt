NOTES:
    Need to update tables having locations so that x,y,z are all numeric and not strings

    Resources that start with @ in their name do not take up inventory space

    How to construct buildings/ships from specific buildings?
        @Building/@Ship for produced good?

    NEED TO TEST ShipDAO getShipsAtLocation for both on planet and in system
